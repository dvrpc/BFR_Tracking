The roadway cross-section, even with reducing travel lane and parking lane widths, is not sufficient to accomodate either parking-protected or conventional bike lanes. The area has relatively high density neighborhoods and has businesses and schools in close proximity, the speed (35 mph) and commerical use of the corridor (heavy delivery truck, school bus traffic) may pose safety issues such as impeding visibility when parked. Thus, sharrows are not a safe option up until the Eagle Rd. intersection.

The Kennett Pike Bikeway project is a plan to improve bicycling conditions along Route 52. Currently in construction, shoulders are being improved along Route 52 from Route 1 to the PA/DE State Line. Moving forward, the Township could consider the addition of bicycle lane legends. This is dependent on the status and required provisions of PennDOT’s Bicycle Occupancy Permit. Additionally, the Township should coordinate with Pennsbury in support of completing the missing link in Pennsbury to the Route 52 corridor to connect all the way to the DE State line; this project is listed on the 2013 TII. The Township should also continue to coordinate with Longwood Gardens and PennDOT in determining how to best align a cycling connection/extension from Route 52/ Kennett Pike Bikeway along Route 1 to Hamorton and Longwood Gardens.”

The widening would need to be done prior to overlay. In February 2018, Lou Belmonte spoke with Chester County Maintenance Manager Bob Kennedy, who showed interest in performing this widening work from his maintenance budget, and using his own work crew.   ", ,Municipalities reached out to PennDOT in 2018 and coordination has been ongoing. ," 5' bike lanes are possible but the posted speeds here are 45 mph, which is too high for a facility that does not have any sort of buffer or protection. To achieve consistent 5' shoulders, widening would be needed at the approaches to Chadbury Rd. / Balmoral Drive. From Balmoral Drive to Cossart Rd the travel lanes should be narrowed to 11 feet each way  to create a 5' SB bikelane. Fairhill Drive to Cosart Manor Drive, narrow travel lanes to 11 feet to make consistent 5 foot bike lanes. 

Because speeds are so high and buffers are not possible throughout, I would recommend using profiled striping on the edgelines to create a tactile warning for vehicles.

Pottstown Pike at Goshen: 54 ft
NB: 10 ft. buffered bike lane from Goshen Road to 322 off ramp
At off ramp, mark perpendicular bicycle crossing with green conflict markings at stop sign and provide advanced warning signage. 

SB: Buffered bike lane- from Goshen Road to 322 on ramp

At 322 off-ramp widen shoulder using space from center median area or slightly narrow off ramp mouth and create a bicycle crossing perpendicular to the ramp with green conflict markings. Advanced warning signage, yield markings, and RRFBs are also suggested at these types of crossings. 

From 322 on/off ramps stripe Buffered bike lanes both directions until Caswallen Drive. 

Caswallen to Primrose, mark buffered lane sb and narrow nb lane as much as possible to mark 5 foot conventional bicycle lane.

From Primrose to the northern Saint Agnes cemetary entrance on SB side, narrow 11 ft  median, and widen shoulders to create buffered bicycle lanes in the shoulders.

North Saint Agnes Cemetary entrance to Grove Road (AADT ~3,300 near Grubbs Mill Rd): Is the left turnlane for Grove road needed? If so, narrow lanes as much as possible and mark as large a shoulder as possible. 

Grove Road to North of Arams Rd: Very difficult section. Bike facilities may not be possible. Narrow travel and turn lanes as much as possible to create shoulder. 

Other possibilities: 
Grove Road to Arams Rd.- Take Center Median and stripe conventional (or buffered bicycle lanes if possible) in both directions. 

At Aram Rd Intersection: NB- Stripe bicycle lane between center lane and right turn lane with conflict markings at entrance to right turn. Anyone know why there is a left turn lane here? There is no road to turn left to. 

North side of arams rd intersection to south of west chester animal clinic: narrow travel lanes to 11 feet and turn lane to 10 feet and widen shoulders to widen shoulders. 

South of west chester animal clinic to Wawa driveway south of Greenhill.  Stripe buffered bike lanes in both directions until greenroad hill intersection approach. 

On NB Side from Wawa driveway to greenhill rd. stripe conflict markings across driveway, at beginning of right turn lane narrow lanes and median to stripe bicycle lane between the center and right turn lanes. 

SB Side, shoulder is overgrown. Consider also reducing lane to 10 ft to create enough space for a 5 foot conventional bicycle lane or 4 foot shoulder. 

Northside of Greenhill Rd to South of Manor Rd. narrow lanes to 10 ft and widen shoulders as much as possible.

South of Manor Rd. Roadway widens and buffered bike lanes are possible in both directions until Kirkland Rd. Consider Neckdowns at Burke Rd. Old Pottstown Pike, to reduce bicyclist exposure and slow down turning vehicles. 

Kirkland to Katie Way- conventional or buffered bike lanes where possible.
At SB turn onto Katie Way- mark turn lane with sharrow. 

Katie Way to Boot Road- NB Buffered bike lane, 
SB-narrow the center median area to standard double line and create 5 foot conventional bicycle lane until shoulder widens. 

Might also consider making the SB right lane at Boot Rood Right turn only, and making the center lane the only through lane, This would allow for for more space in the shoulder for bicycles as well as buses pulling over to pick up passengers at the bus stop.

Low speed, but sharrows unfavorable because of high volumes. Recommend bike lanes on both sides from Marshall Road to Patterson Ave (5 ft wide and narrow travel lanes to 10 ft wide), parking-protected (5' wide with 4' buffer) bike lane (west side) and buffered (5' wide with 2' buffer) bike lane (east side) from Patterson Ave to Guilford Road, bike lanes (5 ft wide and narrow travel lanes to 10 ft wide) from Guilford Road to Baltimore Pike. Typically, an AADT of over 10000 requires a separated or buffered bike lane, but the low posted speed and possibility of a continuous bicycle route through the entire corridor gives some wiggle room with warranting the installation of a conventional bike lane. A speed study would be useful to get an idea of vehicle behavior that would affect cyclist comfort and safety using non-buffered bike lanes.

"," Low (~2500) AADT and speed (25 mph) between E 4th St. and E 12th St. allow for bike lanes. There is not adequate ROW from the I-95 overpass to E 14h St. intersection, at which point a road diet would be best for cyclist comfort- AADT is about 4000, a four lane cross section is not necessary. Recommend continuing the road diet through the entirety of the four-lane cross section, which ends at E 22nd St. From there until the Harvey St. intersection, the centerline can be shifted to make space for bike lanes on either side (cartway is about 30' wide). Recommend narrowing lanes at the Harvey Rd. intersection to 10 feet to make space for a bike lane on both shoulders of PA-320 until the shoulder widens considerably after the Sproul Ln. intersection. Recommend continuing a buffered bike lane on either side (which will require removing the shared turn lane from the Canterbury Drive intersection to the 476 overpass, and narrowing lanes after 476 overpass). Once the bike lanes terminate at Fairview Road, recommend installing sharrows on local N-S roads (such as Cornell Ave. or Rutgers Ave.), as PA-320 narrows considerably while maintaining a high AADT (~10000) and becomes unsuitable for cyclists. To establish a connection to the North side of the Swarthmore station, it is recommended to install a bikable shoulder from the Fieldhouse Ln. traffic circle to College Ave.

However, this would require a study which is not within the scope of this project. 4th St to 12th Street:  Speed limit = 25 mph. ADT is between 1307 and 2502 vpd. 14th St to 22nd St: Speed limit is 35 mph. ADT NB = 4095 vpd, ADT SB = 4029 vpd. Existing roadway width is about 42 feet.

There is not adequate ROW from the I-95 overpass to E 14h St. intersection, at which point a road diet would be best for cyclist comfort- AADT is about 4000, a four lane cross section is not necessary. Recommend continuing the road diet through the entirety of the four-lane cross section, which ends at E 22nd St. From there until the Harvey St. intersection, the centerline can be shifted to make space for bike lanes on either side (cartway is about 30' wide). Recommend narrowing lanes at the Harvey Rd. intersection to 10 feet to make space for a bike lane on both shoulders of PA-320 until the shoulder widens considerably after the Sproul Ln. intersection. Recommend continuing a buffered bike lane on either side (which will require removing the shared turn lane from the Canterbury Drive intersection to the 476 overpass, and narrowing lanes after 476 overpass). Once the bike lanes terminate at Fairview Road, recommend installing sharrows on local N-S roads (such as Cornell Ave. or Rutgers Ave.), as PA-320 narrows considerably while maintaining a high AADT (~10000) and becomes unsuitable for cyclists. To establish a connection to the North side of the Swarthmore station, it is recommended to install a bikable shoulder from the Fieldhouse Ln. traffic circle to College Ave.

Since sections of High Street to be repaved already have bike lanes and apparent potential for more bicycle facilities east of the terminus of the current bike lanes, we consider this is a strong candidate for further consideration.",Existing bike lanes on the west end in Pottstown.

- Extending the existing Pottstown Borough buffered bike lanes from Roland Street to Rosedale Drive appears feasible. In this section the existing roadway width is about 50' wide with a 25 mph speed limit. One existing travel lane in each direction with a center, two-way left turn lane - make each 10' wide. Match and extend the existing 5' buffered bike lanes in each direction with a buffer on the vehicular side and a buffer on the curb side. 
- Existing on-street parking will need to removed and formally restricted with signing if bike lanes are installed.

",0,0,N/A,,N/A,,,,,No, ,,,, ,,,,,, ," Besides proposed treatment, maintain 11 foot lane widths, maximize shoulder width. 6 foot minimum shoulders preferable.

PennDOT Feedback noted and the limitations of what can be done with this project understood.  This is why the initial recommendations from the MCPC was to maximize shoulder width where possible but to NOT paint dedicated bike lanes at this time.

Ultimately 8 to 10 foot shoulders for buffered or protected bike lane as per Bike Montco plan should be built.

", ,No,2022-03-30 08:55:04,No,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,"• Sharrows through Schwenksville are a viable treatment due to the 25 mph speed limit.  
• Areas within Perkiomenville and Green Lane would be similar.  
• Outside of the urban locations the road widens but is inconsistent in width.  From our basic Google Earth measurements it appears to vary from 29’-33’ in width but in most cases is less than the 32’ width we would need for actual bike lanes.  Your notes say “maximize the shoulder” so we weren’t sure if you were looking for actual bike lanes or just shoulders.  The lanes out there now are 11’ wide.

Posted speed: 40mph
AADT: 8,800-15,000 (increasing west to east)
- Given the existing 40mph speed limit, Fitzwatertown Road between Jenkintown Road and Old Welsh Road is eligible for a buffered bicycle lane, but an unbuffered lane is not recommended considering existing traffic volumes and speed. 
- Between Old Welsh Road and York Road, AADT exceed 10,000 vehicles per day. At 40mph, only a separated bicycle lane or shared-use path would be recommended given these volumes.

Restriping Recommendations:
- Between Jenkintown Road and Old Welsh Road, narrow travel lanes to 11 feet, and add space for two 4.5-foot bicycle lanes with 2-foot buffers. Where existing shoulder exceeds 35 feet, a wider bicycle lane and/or buffer may be possible. At intersections with Jenkintown Road, Susquehanna Road, Woodland Road, and Old Welsh Road, left turn lanes leave little room for lanes; sharrows can take the place of lanes for short distances to get cyclists through the intersection (about 200 feet; high-visibility green paint backing would be ideal). Left-turn bike boxes would also improve bicycle safety at these intersections by providing a safe, clear, two-stage turn.

Supplemental recommendations:
- At intersections where proposed bicycle lanes are briefly supplemented by sharrows, MUTCD R4-11 signs (Bicycles May Use Full Lane) would improve safety if implemented through another program.
- Between Old Welsh Road and York Road, existing conditions require physical separation to ensure a safe bicycle facility.

•	On-street parking appears to be permitted along much of this corridor. If bike lanes are installed, parking would likely need to be restricted. However, on-street parking in this area does not appear to be heavily utilized. Municipalities would need to decide if parking elimination is acceptable.

•	Welsh Road and York Road, the existing roadway width is between 40' and 42'. This is a three-lane section of Fitzwatertown Road and does not have enough width to add bike lanes. Removal of the two-way left turn lane does not appear to be the correct treatment due to the high number of cross streets. Removal would require study and analysis of left turning traffic.

If either of these treatments are found infeasible, we think our initial recommendation of standard bike lanes is still worthwhile given borough interest--they would reduce the facility LTS from 4 to 3, and provide a bike connection between borough neighborhoods and a key commercial hub.

In addition, here are some supplemental comments from Brian Styche at Chester County, who also supports improvements at this location:

Thanks for the heads up and opportunity to comment.  I replied to Tom Yuhas last week about this possibility and glad to see it moving forward.  The Central Chesco Bike/Ped plan does conceptually call for bike lanes along Business 30 from approximately the Church Farm School in the east (beyond Exton Mall) to PA 113 in the west.  To that end, I agree that it would be beneficial to have more time to review and design the entire proposed resurfacing area ahead of this opportunity, which is the ultimate goal with these resurfacing plans, Connects, etc.

With respect to the route you have indicated, you may want to check with the Borough regarding on-street parking.  In Google street view, the lanes do appear to be wide enough to easily add bike lanes from Woodbine west to Wagner, but I also noticed painted curbs nearest intersections and fire hydrants indicating that on-street parking may be allowed. 

Heading east from Woodbine, there may be an opportunity to connect to the Brandywine Square entrance which is the next traffic light to the east.  That would provide a connection between the shopping center and a predominantly residential area in the Borough.  The existing shoulder on the south side is fairly wide, and the gore area between Woodbine and the Brandywine Square entrance acts as a two-way left turn lane – with nowhere to turn.  I think that center area could be reduced if necessary to provide space for bike lanes between the additional turn lanes at the intersections on either end.  I do believe that bike lanes may be a possibility for the remainder of the resurfacing area eastward and into East Caln, but again may require more time for design.",4,3,0,In Central ChesCo bike/ped plan,Local idea/plan,ST-15,6/8/2018, , ,No,"Downingtown: Thomas J.

Bike lanes are feasible between Pottstown Pike and Newcomen Road. 
At Pottstown Pike, lanes can be narrowed to 11 ft to build a 5 foot bicycle lane in the existing EB shoulder and between the through and right turn lane WB. Halfway to Bausman Road, the shoulders widen considerably allowing for buffered bike lanes on the EB side of the road up Newcomen Road. WB the shoulder slightly in the approach to the Newcomen Road intersection, here you could move the center line slightly and diet the lanes to create enough space for a bike lane, or slightly widen the shoulder in the 100' approach to the intersection. 

The roadway between Newcomen and Valley Hill Road (where the Uwchlan trail begins) would also benefit from widening. It currently narrows to roughly 26' and has AADT's (2018) of ~8400.

Heading north, between County Way and Red Cedar Dr., buffered bike lanes are feasible. This 700’ segment would connect a library and other Township buildings to a neighborhood and an off-street multi-use trail. 
Between Red Cedar Dr. and Appletree Dr., the ROW narrows to about 29’, enough for 10’ drive lanes and 4.5’ bike lanes. Even though this parallels the multi-use trail I recommend striping this segment for bike lanes because there is a crosswalk at Appletree Dr., which would provide safer access to the multi-use trail than an uncontrolled intersection. Alternatively, a new crosswalk at Red Cedar Dr. would provide a safe crossing to the multi-use trail. 
The trail continues north, ending at Appletree Pl., where I recommend a crosswalk to return bike traffic back on-street. Continuing north to Penn Valley Rd./Hood Blvd., existing shoulders are wide enough for buffered bike lanes. This intersection needs special attention, as it’s got several turn movements, and gets heavy youth pedestrian traffic from the adjacent Pennsbury High School (3000+ students). Fixing this intersection (especially if you could work with Falls Twp. on safe bike lanes on Hood Blvd.) would be a huge win for users of all ages.
North to Thornridge Pass, the road is wide enough for 5-6’ conventional bike lanes, if the center turn lane shrinks to approximately 9’. The shoulders disappear from roughly Thornridge Pass to Vermillion Dr. Technically, sharrows would work for this 1000’ segment, though I would recommend signage and possibly yield markings where bike lanes end. North of Vermillion Dr. existing shoulders are wide enough for buffered bike lanes. I recommend intersection crossing markings north across Tyburn Rd. to get cyclists to/from Fallsington.

From Ferry Rd to Curly Rd bike lanes do not appear feasible due to insufficient roadway widths and sharrows not recommended due to speeds/volumes.

Great Newtown-to-Langhorne connector with good school, employer, and park access is possible on the longer segment:
South from PA-332, roadway is 38’-40’ wide, buffered bike lanes (5’bike lane, 2-3’ buffer, depending on ROW width) and 12’ vehicular lanes are feasible. Vehicular lanes could also narrow to 11’ to discourage speeding. At Pennswood Village Dr./Tollgate Rd., there should be enough width to drop to 5’ conventional bike lanes, and preserve existing turn lanes, as long as they’re narrowed to 10.5’-11’. 
South to Alberts Way the ROW is wide enough for 5-6’ conventional bike lanes (depending on total ROW width) and 11’ vehicular lanes. At Alberts Way, there is a curbed left-turn lane which narrows the southbound ROW to 14’ Since this is a very short stretch, it is probably acceptable to narrow the SB bike lane to 4’, or at least stripe a shoulder without a bike legend. The St. Mary Medical Center entrance intersection needs a more focused design, but some things to consider: St. Mary’s is a big employer who may appreciate bike commute access; and there are trail entrances here to Core Creek Park.
Continuing south to Heatons Mill Rd., the ROW varies between 42’ and 46’ wide, with a large NB shoulder and no SB shoulder. I recommend a 10’ center turn lane, 11’-12’ vehicular lanes, and 5-6’ conventional bike lanes, depending on total ROW width. South to Bridgetown Pike, the ROW is wide enough for 5’conventional bike lanes, expanding to buffered bike lanes (5-6’ bike lane, 3’ buffer) as you approach Bridgetown Pike.
South of Bridgetown Pike, existing shoulders are generally wide enough for 5-6’ conventional bike lanes. I recommend keeping vehicular lanes to 11’ through this segment. There is a major pinch point at the CSX rail bridge. Speeds are probably high, but a dashed ending to the bike lane and sharrows approaching the underpass could be effective. South to Watson Ave. the ROW is 35-36’ wide, so 11’ vehicle lanes and 6-7’ bike lanes are feasible as you enter Langhorne.

From W. Trenton Ave to Rt. 1 South onramp, buffered bike lanes (5ft lane, 3ft buffer) are feasible with removal of on-street parking (all houses have driveways, so may be worth the effort). At Rt. 1 South onramp for westbound cyclists, I recommend either a two-stage turn marking at the far side of the signal, or a bike box at the stop bar so cyclists can make the left to continue south on Woolston. 
On the final North/South segment to Stony Hill Road, the same width buffered bike lanes are feasible, but I recommend a wider buffer and narrowed vehicular lane in the northbound-to-eastbound slip lane to address sight distance issues.

On-street parking does not appear to be heavily utilized. Buffered bike lanes appear feasibile if on-street parking can be restricted, however the municipality will have to approve this restriction. Sharrows are not feasible along this corridor due to the combination of speed and volumes.

The short segment from the US 1 Ramp to Stony Hil Road is roughly 76' wide with 10' shoulders and two vehicular lanes in each direction. Therefore, buffered bike lanes appear feasible in this section. The travel lane could be slightly narrowed to 11' and the buffer area increased on the northbound-to-eastbound slip lane to help improve sight distance for vehicles approaching bikes around the curve. A two-stage bike turn marking on the far side of the intersection to help facilitate left turns for bikes would require installation of additional signal heads, which is outside the scope of this program.

The bridge under the rail yard is a major pinch point, but worth taking a look at in the future. Heading east, existing shoulders are wide enough for a generous buffered bike lane in each direction (6-7’ bike lanes with 2-3’ buffers). It looks like the shoulders are occasionally used for on-street parking up to Makefield Rd., which may be something to check in with the Township about. Please see DVRPC’s guidance for bike/ped facilities at expressway interchanges (https://www.dvrpc.org/Reports/19025.pdf) when looking at the Woolston Dr./Lincoln Hwy/Route 1 onramp. 
East of W. Trenton Ave, the road has excess lane capacity. I’d recommend reducing to a single vehicle lane per direction, and buffered bike lanes can be included as part of a narrowing strategy. There aren’t a ton of bikeable destinations here at the moment, but there’s no reason not to do a safe lane, and it could become useful if the large commercial/industrial parcels here ever get redeveloped. 
East of 981 Lincoln Hwy., the road becomes a limited-access highway, and shouldn’t include bike facilities.

Between Hatboro Road and Second Street Pike, consistent bike lanes are not feasible. 

Between Second Street Pike and Harmony Drive, buffered bike lanes are feasible in the existing stacking/right turn lanes. I recommend converting a short portion of these existing lanes into a striped right turn only/bike mixing zone (see NACTO: https://nacto.org/publication/urban-bikeway-design-guide/intersection-treatments/combined-bike-laneturn-lane/) to preserve right turn capacity.

Between Harmony Drive and the westernmost Township recreation area driveway, where there is a partially-curbed median and turn lane, I recommend sharrows. This area has already received some speed control treatments, and I think narrowing the travel lanes to the west by introducing buffered bike lanes may further slow auto speeds.

West of the Township rec area, depending on the crown of the road, I recommend reconfiguring the roadway for two 6’-wide bike lanes, and two 11’-wide travel lanes.

Between Lookover Lane and Schuyler Drive, there may be enough roadway width for two 10’-travel lanes and two 5’-wide bike lanes. If not, I recommend a sharrow for the downhill (eastbound) lane, and a 6’-wide “climbing” bike lane in the uphill (westbound) direction. (See Midvale Ave in East Falls, Philadelphia for a regional example: https://goo.gl/maps/wpe3MTmXkhmHUzEN9)

Between Schuyler Drive and Creamery Road, there are several shoulders/right turn lanes that are very wide, and could easily accommodate a buffered or protected bike lane. But, those lanes are not consistent. The speed limit (40 mph) is technically too high for sharrows, but it may be worth considering them to get through short pinch points. There are also several, fragmented multi-use paths. Though they typically coincide with the wider segments of roadway, they may help to cobble together a continuous bike facility. This segment warrants further study.

North from Post Rd., there is a generous (8’+) parking lane in each direction, which appears to be well used. Sharrows may be appropriate from here north, as the land use becomes more neighborhood-residential. Between Philadelphia Ave. and Bridge St. there is no parking lane, buffered bike lanes are feasible, and may help to reduce speeding. Continuing north through Morrisville Borough to W. Trenton Ave.., sharrows are appropriate if on-street parking cannot be removed for buffered bike lanes. North to Yardley Morrisville Rd, sharrrows are technically appropriate (35mph), though I know speeding is more of an issue here. It may be helpful to stripe the shoulders to narrow the travel lanes down to about 10.5’, which may slow traffic closer to 35mph, and provide a narrow shoulder for confident cyclists.

Recommend a conventional bike lane from Pennhurst to Glass Avenue. From Glass Avenue to Main Street you could do sharrows in both directions OR possibly move the center line a bit to the south and create a 4 foot bike lane/ bikeable shoulder along the north side of the street adjacent to the curb- this would provide a more comfortable condition for cyclists biking up the hill and would reduce speed differential conflicts.

Speed: 45-50mph
Shoulders:
No shoulders present at for 250ft on southbound between Marshall and Ridge Rd.

The road shoulders are inconsistent, but generally from 7-10ft. While the recommended facility is protected bike lanes (typically require 10ft), the shoulders throughout the corridor dip between 5ft-6.5ft in a few areas. Speeds are high enough in this corridor to be hesitant about these segments. Requires further study to identify segments, and whether space can be taken to expand the shoulder slightly. May require slightly more funding than Bike Friendly Resurfacing to accommodate a few pinch points. However, in some areas, the lanes might be able to shift to provide more space for buffered paths.

Ex. The southbound lane just north of Pyle Rd is only 5 ft. And dips to 2ft north of McComb Ave on northbound, north of Smithbridge Rd on southbound side, and north of Applied Bank Blnd on the northbound.

Shoulders/lanes:
Only one lane of traffic for each direction. Shoulders are very inconsistent, and are generally at or below 5ft and sometimes disappear. Some very brief stretches have around 10ft. Taking a couple feet from the vehicle lanes would provide minimal help. More funding may be necessary to create more consistent space. Roadway tends to be adjacent to private property in areas where the shoulder is limited.

NOTE: Small portion at in the west end of the corridor has recommendations for brief bike lane in FY22 Delco Bike Network project. It was determined at the beginning of the project year that bike friendly resurfacing ""style"" facilities would be difficult to achieve on the rest of the corridor.

Not sure where bike facilities would fit as part of a resurfacing only, but I see from the Route 202 Trail Extension Feasibility Study that the preferred alternative includes a portion alongside the NB 202 offramp at Easton Road, then a segment along Easton Road, then alongside the SB 202 onramp.

See DVRPC's Guidance for Pedestrian and Bicycle Facilities at Expressway Interchanges in Southeastern Pennsylvania report (https://www.dvrpc.org/Reports/19025.pdf) for design guidance at the various slip lanes.

West of New Falls Road, the road becomes more of a limited access highway, and bike lanes aren't feasible.

As an aside, perhaps this segment should be considered for lane reduction in the future, as distribution center truck traffic has better Rt. 13 and Rt. 1 access west of New Falls Road than they do at Tyburn Rd./Woolston Dr. Freeing up that connection could dramatically improve multimodal mobility across a major physical and social divider (Route 1/rail ROW).",0,0,N/A,,N/A,,,,,N/A,,,,,,,,,,, ," Although not a priority, this could serve as a connection between PA Bicycle Route E and the D&L Trail.

Cartway is 35-40' throughout the corridor when parking is not considered. If parking removal is considered, there is certainly room for buffered bicycle lanes. On segments where there is a 40' cartway, only one lane of parking would have to be removed. Capacity analysis would likely be necessary in places where turning movements would have to be combined (e.g., Main and Broad). 

North of Richardson Ave, on-street parking appears to be less utilized, with a large number of surface parking lots. Richardson Ave through Line street is the commercial core, where parking utilization appears to be higher. South of Line Street, land use begins to shift, and there is adequate width for buffered bicycle facilities, and on-street parking is no longer an issue. The school and park, as well as surrounding low stress streets (which connect to the Liberty Bell Trail) would benefit from this connection.
