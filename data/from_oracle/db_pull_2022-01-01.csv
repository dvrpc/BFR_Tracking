Lots of potential here: the segment passes the 101 Trolley Station, shops near the Saxer and Powell intersection, and a lot of lower stress neighborhood streets. I recommend sharrows at a minimum (assuming truck volumes are suitable). Depending on the local appetite I could even see the case for shifting on street parking to side streets and striping bike lanes throughout with a bike boulevard between Powell Rd. and Rolling Rd. This connection has great potential to enhance the surrounding area's access to transit and shops, and act as a base for future network expansion.",0,0,N/A,,N/A,,,,,N/A," Lee Fulton, Township Manager",,,,09/20/2021,,,,,, , Not on County Bike Plan, Route 101 Trolley Saxter Ave stop; Springfield grid,Yes,2021-09-20 15:48:22,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,Yes," Bike lanes and sharrows (where there is street parking) are feasible in this segment

Sharrows are infeasible due to high volumes, speeds, and heavy truck traffic. It is impossible to add bicycle lanes to the current cross-section (little to no shoulder available for use).

PennDOT Notes reviewed (2/22/2019).  There is no ask for bike lanes or shoulders on Trooper between SR422 and Egypt Road.  At this time we specifically ask that PennDOT try and maximize shoulder width where practical north of Egypt Road.  There is and never was an ask for a bike route between Trooper to the Schuylkill River Trail via Mill Road and Port Indian Road.  We at the MCPC are very much aware of this LTS 2 connection but are keenly aware that this would be very much beyond the scope of this repaving project.  This is why we merely ask for shoulders to be widen as much as possible were practical to do so.  We believe doing this simple improvement will be of great benefit to cyclists and pedestrians traversing this portion of SR363 while staying within the project scope.

However we now note (2/22/2019) that Ridge Pike between Park and Trooper is at a minimum 42 feet wide between intersections with 14 foot lanes (14, 14, 14).  Either now or in the future (we know that other improvements are coming to Ridge Pike at Trooper) we would like to see the lane widths reduced to allow for (5,11,11,11,5) configuration if not wider shoulders between intersections.

Finally Park Ave north of Ridge Pike is NOT part of the Bike Montco Network./  However we also note that in many places curb to curb width is over 30 feet wide between intersections.  We ask that PennDOT consider again trying to maximize shoulder width were practical to do so where excess roadway width allows.", ,No,2019-07-22 10:42:29,No,Yes,No,Yes,Yes," South of Egypt Rd. there does not appear to be width for bike lanes although we we’re not sure if that was even the ask as opposed to just trying to maximize shoulders?  The road is wide but has multiple lanes which in most areas have no shoulder and are in curbed sections.  Beginning approximately 750 north of Egypt the road narrows but maintains a 32’ +/- width and would allow for 5’ bike lanes in both directions.  From Mill Rd to Oakdale Rd it looks like a decent candidate for such a treatment.  However, this section is just over a half mile in length and it seems to be a bit of an orphan without some logical connection to a park or trail, etc.  One possibility we thought of would be to add these bike lanes on combination with sharrows on Mill Rd. and Port Indian Rd. which would then connect the many local neighborhoods just off 363 with the Schuylkill River Trail.  This would need local cooperation and the signs on the local roads would be outside of our ST project and thus would have to be purchased and installed separately.  The other concern would be the crossing of Egypt between Mill Rd and Port Indian Rd.  This is uncontrolled and must be evaluated for safety.  Possibly a pedestrian flasher would be an appropriate treatment if there was interest in the overall concept.  Once again, any pedestrian flasher would be outside the scope of the ST project and thus would have to be a local municipal responsibility to fund, install and maintain.

PennDOT Notes reviewed (2/22/2019). There is no ask for bike lanes or shoulders on Trooper between SR422 and Egypt Road. At this time we specifically ask that PennDOT try and maximize shoulder width where practical north of Egypt Road. There is and never was an ask for a bike route between Trooper to the Schuylkill River Trail via Mill Road and Port Indian Road. We at the MCPC are very much aware of this LTS 2 connection but are keenly aware that this would be very much beyond the scope of this repaving project. This is why we merely ask for shoulders to be widen as much as possible were practical to do so. We believe doing this simple improvement will be of great benefit to cyclists and pedestrians traversing this portion of SR363 while staying within the project scope.

However we now note (2/22/2019) that Ridge Pike between Park and Trooper is at a minimum 42 feet wide between intersections with 14 foot lanes (14, 14, 14). Either now or in the future (we know that other improvements are coming to Ridge Pike at Trooper) we would like to see the lane widths reduced to allow for (5,11,11,11,5) configuration if not wider shoulders between intersections.

Finally Park Ave north of Ridge Pike is NOT part of the Bike Montco Network./ However we also note that in many places curb to curb width is over 30 feet wide between intersections. We ask that PennDOT consider again trying to maximize shoulder width were practical to do so where excess roadway width allows.", ,No,2019-07-22 10:42:47,No,Yes,No,Yes,Yes," South of Egypt Rd. there does not appear to be width for bike lanes although we we’re not sure if that was even the ask as opposed to just trying to maximize shoulders?  The road is wide but has multiple lanes which in most areas have no shoulder and are in curbed sections.  Beginning approximately 750 north of Egypt the road narrows but maintains a 32’ +/- width and would allow for 5’ bike lanes in both directions.  From Mill Rd to Oakdale Rd it looks like a decent candidate for such a treatment.  However, this section is just over a half mile in length and it seems to be a bit of an orphan without some logical connection to a park or trail, etc.  One possibility we thought of would be to add these bike lanes on combination with sharrows on Mill Rd. and Port Indian Rd. which would then connect the many local neighborhoods just off 363 with the Schuylkill River Trail.  This would need local cooperation and the signs on the local roads would be outside of our ST project and thus would have to be purchased and installed separately.  The other concern would be the crossing of Egypt between Mill Rd and Port Indian Rd.  This is uncontrolled and must be evaluated for safety.  Possibly a pedestrian flasher would be an appropriate treatment if there was interest in the overall concept.  Once again, any pedestrian flasher would be outside the scope of the ST project and thus would have to be a local municipal responsibility to fund, install and maintain.

Posted speed: 40mph

- Given the existing 40mph speed limit, Fitzwatertown Road between Jenkintown Road and Old Welsh Road is eligible for a buffered bicycle lane, but an unbuffered lane is not recommended considering existing traffic volumes and speed. 
- Between Old Welsh Road and York Road, AADT exceed 10,000 vehicles per day. At 40mph, only a separated bicycle lane or shared-use path would be recommended given these volumes.

Restriping Recommendations:
- Between Jenkintown Road and Old Welsh Road, narrow travel lanes to 11 feet, and add space for two 4.5-foot bicycle lanes with 2-foot buffers. Where existing shoulder exceeds 35 feet, a wider bicycle lane and/or buffer may be possible. At intersections with Jenkintown Road, Susquehanna Road, Woodland Road, and Old Welsh Road, left turn lanes leave little room for lanes; sharrows can take the place of lanes for short distances to get cyclists through the intersection (about 200 feet; high-visibility green paint backing would be ideal). Left-turn bike boxes would also improve bicycle safety at these intersections by providing a safe, clear, two-stage turn.

Supplemental recommendations:
- At intersections where proposed bicycle lanes are briefly supplemented by sharrows, MUTCD R4-11 signs (Bicycles May Use Full Lane) would improve safety if implemented through another program.
- Between Old Welsh Road and York Road, existing conditions require physical separation to ensure a safe bicycle facility.

•	Sharrows and ""Bicycles May Use Full Lane"" signs will be used to help guide bicyclists through signalized intersections where continuous bike lanes are not feasible.       
•	Welsh Road and York Road, the existing roadway width is between 40' and 42'. This is a three-lane section of Fitzwatertown Road and does not have enough width to add bike lanes. Removal of the two-way left turn lane does not appear to be the correct treatment due to the high number of cross streets. Removal would require study and analysis of left turning traffic.                         
•	DVRPC should coordinate with the appropriate municipalities ASAP for implementation.

There is not adequate ROW from the I-95 overpass to E 14h St. intersection, at which point a road diet would be best for cyclist comfort- AADT is about 4000, a four lane cross section is not necessary. Recommend continuing the road diet through the entirety of the four-lane cross section, which ends at E 22nd St. From there until the Harvey St. intersection, the centerline can be shifted to make space for bike lanes on either side (cartway is about 30' wide). Recommend narrowing lanes at the Harvey Rd. intersection to 10 feet to make space for a bike lane on both shoulders of PA-320 until the shoulder widens considerably after the Sproul Ln. intersection. Recommend continuing a buffered bike lane on either side (which will require removing the shared turn lane from the Canterbury Drive intersection to the 476 overpass, and narrowing lanes after 476 overpass). Once the bike lanes terminate at Fairview Road, recommend installing sharrows on local N-S roads (such as Cornell Ave. or Rutgers Ave.), as PA-320 narrows considerably while maintaining a high AADT (~10000) and becomes unsuitable for cyclists. To establish a connection to the North side of the Swarthmore station, it is recommended to install a bikable shoulder from the Fieldhouse Ln. traffic circle to College Ave.

The study has a preliminary striping plan which Rachael will share with us. There are currently bike lanes to the east on Rt 30 that stop at the intersection with First Ave. The study includes a concept to continue bike lanes/sharrows west from First Ave to 82 southbound. On Rt 82 going south through East Fallowfield Twp, the muni's comp plan includes a bike connection, but it looks tight, so a trail might be a better fit (beyond the scope of a resurfacing)
The 2016 Route 30 Multimodal Transportation Study shows recommendations for bike lanes on Business Route 30 from Church Street  to 1st Avenue as well as other re-striping changes. I’ve attached the relevant pages from that report.
The 2015 East Fallowfield Township Comprehensive Plan (linked here) proposes a Trail Corridor on or along Route 82 from Route 30 south to Strasburg Road. I’ve attached an annotated map.

Low speed, but sharrows unfavorable because of high volumes. Recommend bike lanes on both sides from Marshall Road to Patterson Ave (5 ft wide and narrow travel lanes to 10 ft wide), parking-protected (5' wide with 4' buffer) bike lane (west side) and buffered (5' wide with 2' buffer) bike lane (east side) from Patterson Ave to Guilford Road, bike lanes (5 ft wide and narrow travel lanes to 10 ft wide) from Guilford Road to Baltimore Pike. Typically, an AADT of over 10000 requires a separated or buffered bike lane, but the low posted speed and possibility of a continuous bicycle route through the entire corridor gives some wiggle room with warranting the installation of a conventional bike lane.

If either of these treatments are found infeasible, we think our initial recommendation of standard bike lanes is still worthwhile given borough interest--they would reduce the facility LTS from 4 to 3, and provide a bike connection between borough neighborhoods and a key commercial hub.

In addition, here are some supplemental comments from Brian Styche at Chester County, who also supports improvements at this location:

Thanks for the heads up and opportunity to comment.  I replied to Tom Yuhas last week about this possibility and glad to see it moving forward.  The Central Chesco Bike/Ped plan does conceptually call for bike lanes along Business 30 from approximately the Church Farm School in the east (beyond Exton Mall) to PA 113 in the west.  To that end, I agree that it would be beneficial to have more time to review and design the entire proposed resurfacing area ahead of this opportunity, which is the ultimate goal with these resurfacing plans, Connects, etc.

With respect to the route you have indicated, you may want to check with the Borough regarding on-street parking.  In Google street view, the lanes do appear to be wide enough to easily add bike lanes from Woodbine west to Wagner, but I also noticed painted curbs nearest intersections and fire hydrants indicating that on-street parking may be allowed. 

Heading east from Woodbine, there may be an opportunity to connect to the Brandywine Square entrance which is the next traffic light to the east.  That would provide a connection between the shopping center and a predominantly residential area in the Borough.  The existing shoulder on the south side is fairly wide, and the gore area between Woodbine and the Brandywine Square entrance acts as a two-way left turn lane – with nowhere to turn.  I think that center area could be reduced if necessary to provide space for bike lanes between the additional turn lanes at the intersections on either end.  I do believe that bike lanes may be a possibility for the remainder of the resurfacing area eastward and into East Caln, but again may require more time for design.",4,3,0,In Central ChesCo bike/ped plan,Local idea/plan,ST-15,6/8/2018, , ,Yes,"Downingtown: Thomas J.

The Kennett Pike Bikeway project is a plan to improve bicycling conditions along Route 52. Currently in construction, shoulders are being improved along Route 52 from Route 1 to the PA/DE State Line. Moving forward, the Township could consider the addition of bicycle lane legends. This is dependent on the status and required provisions of PennDOT’s Bicycle Occupancy Permit. Additionally, the Township should coordinate with Pennsbury in support of completing the missing link in Pennsbury to the Route 52 corridor to connect all the way to the DE State line; this project is listed on the 2013 TII.

", ,Municipalities reached out to PennDOT in 2018 and coordination has been ongoing. ," 5' bike lanes are possible but the posted speeds here are 45 mph, which is too high for a facility that does not have any sort of buffer or protection. To achieve consistent 5' shoulders, widening would be needed at the approaches to Chadbury Rd. / Balmoral Drive. From Balmoral Drive to Cossart Rd the travel lanes should be narrowed to 11 feet each way  to create a 5' SB bikelane. Fairhill Drive to Cosart Manor Drive, narrow travel lanes to 11 feet to make consistent 5 foot bike lanes. 

Because speeds are so high and buffers are not possible throughout, I would recommend using profiled striping on the edgelines to create a tactile warning for vehicles.

North Saint Agnes Cemetary entrance to Grove Road (AADT ~3,300 near Grubbs Mill Rd): Is the left turnlane for Grove road needed? If so, narrow lanes as much as possible and mark as large a shoulder as possible. 

Grove Road to North of Arams Rd: Very difficult section. Bike facilities may not be possible. Narrow travel and turn lanes as much as possible to create shoulder. 

Other possibilities: 
Grove Road to Arams Rd.- Take Center Median and stripe conventional (or buffered bicycle lanes if possible) in both directions. 

At Aram Rd Intersection: NB- Stripe bicycle lane between center lane and right turn lane with conflict markings at entrance to right turn. Anyone know why there is a left turn lane here? There is no road to turn left to. 

North side of arams rd intersection to south of west chester animal clinic: narrow travel lanes to 11 feet and turn lane to 10 feet and widen shoulders to widen shoulders. 

South of west chester animal clinic to Wawa driveway south of Greenhill.  Stripe buffered bike lanes in both directions until greenroad hill intersection approach. 

On NB Side from Wawa driveway to greenhill rd. stripe conflict markings across driveway, at beginning of right turn lane narrow lanes and median to stripe bicycle lane between the center and right turn lanes. 

SB Side, shoulder is overgrown. Consider also reducing lane to 10 ft to create enough space for a 5 foot conventional bicycle lane or 4 foot shoulder. 

Northside of Greenhill Rd to South of Manor Rd. narrow lanes to 10 ft and widen shoulders as much as possible.

South of Manor Rd. Roadway widens and buffered bike lanes are possible in both directions until Kirkland Rd. Consider Neckdowns at Burke Rd. Old Pottstown Pike, to reduce bicyclist exposure and slow down turning vehicles. 

Kirkland to Katie Way- conventional or buffered bike lanes where possible.
At SB turn onto Katie Way- mark turn lane with sharrow. 

Katie Way to Boot Road- NB Buffered bike lane, 
SB-narrow the center median area to standard double line and create 5 foot conventional bicycle lane until shoulder widens. 

Might also consider making the SB right lane at Boot Rood Right turn only, and making the center lane the only through lane, This would allow for for more space in the shoulder for bicycles as well as buses pulling over to pick up passengers at the bus stop.

Between Lookover Lane and Schuyler Drive, there may be enough roadway width for two 10’-travel lanes and two 5’-wide bike lanes. If not, I recommend a sharrow for the downhill (eastbound) lane, and a 6’-wide “climbing” bike lane in the uphill (westbound) direction. (See Midvale Ave in East Falls, Philadelphia for a regional example: https://goo.gl/maps/wpe3MTmXkhmHUzEN9)

Between Schuyler Drive and Creamery Road, there are several shoulders/right turn lanes that are very wide, and could easily accommodate a buffered or protected bike lane. But, those lanes are not consistent. The speed limit (40 mph) is technically too high for sharrows, but it may be worth considering them to get through short pinch points. There are also several, fragmented multi-use paths. Though they typically coincide with the wider segments of roadway, they may help to cobble together a continuous bike facility. This segment warrants further study.

West of Creamery Road, bike facilities are not feasible.

Between Harmony Drive and the westernmost Township recreation area driveway, where there is a partially-curbed median and turn lane, I recommend sharrows.

Lane reconfiguration may be required and care should be taken where potential new lanes cross Route 100 ramps.

Heading north, between County Way and Red Cedar Dr., buffered bike lanes are feasible. This 700’ segment would connect a library and other Township buildings to a neighborhood and an off-street multi-use trail. 
Between Red Cedar Dr. and Appletree Dr., the ROW narrows to about 29’, enough for 10’ drive lanes and 4.5’ bike lanes. Even though this parallels the multi-use trail I recommend striping this segment for bike lanes because there is a crosswalk at Appletree Dr., which would provide safer access to the multi-use trail than an uncontrolled intersection. Alternatively, a new crosswalk at Red Cedar Dr. would provide a safe crossing to the multi-use trail. 
The trail continues north, ending at Appletree Pl., where I recommend a crosswalk to return bike traffic back on-street. Continuing north to Penn Valley Rd./Hood Blvd., existing shoulders are wide enough for buffered bike lanes. This intersection needs special attention, as it’s got several turn movements, and gets heavy youth pedestrian traffic from the adjacent Pennsbury High School (3000+ students). Fixing this intersection (especially if you could work with Falls Twp. on safe bike lanes on Hood Blvd.) would be a huge win for users of all ages.
North to Thornridge Pass, the road is wide enough for 5-6’ conventional bike lanes, if the center turn lane shrinks to approximately 9’. The shoulders disappear from roughly Thornridge Pass to Vermillion Dr. Technically, sharrows would work for this 1000’ segment, though I would recommend signage and possibly yield markings where bike lanes end. North of Vermillion Dr. existing shoulders are wide enough for buffered bike lanes. I recommend intersection crossing markings north across Tyburn Rd. to get cyclists to/from Fallsington.

Great Newtown-to-Langhorne connector with good school, employer, and park access is possible on the longer segment:
South from PA-332, roadway is 38’-40’ wide, buffered bike lanes (5’bike lane, 2-3’ buffer, depending on ROW width) and 12’ vehicular lanes are feasible. Vehicular lanes could also narrow to 11’ to discourage speeding. At Pennswood Village Dr./Tollgate Rd., there should be enough width to drop to 5’ conventional bike lanes, and preserve existing turn lanes, as long as they’re narrowed to 10.5’-11’. 
South to Alberts Way the ROW is wide enough for 5-6’ conventional bike lanes (depending on total ROW width) and 11’ vehicular lanes. At Alberts Way, there is a curbed left-turn lane which narrows the southbound ROW to 14’ Since this is a very short stretch, it is probably acceptable to narrow the SB bike lane to 4’, or at least stripe a shoulder without a bike legend. The St. Mary Medical Center entrance intersection needs a more focused design, but some things to consider: St. Mary’s is a big employer who may appreciate bike commute access; and there are trail entrances here to Core Creek Park.
Continuing south to Heatons Mill Rd., the ROW varies between 42’ and 46’ wide, with a large NB shoulder and no SB shoulder. I recommend a 10’ center turn lane, 11’-12’ vehicular lanes, and 5-6’ conventional bike lanes, depending on total ROW width. South to Bridgetown Pike, the ROW is wide enough for 5’conventional bike lanes, expanding to buffered bike lanes (5-6’ bike lane, 3’ buffer) as you approach Bridgetown Pike.
South of Bridgetown Pike, existing shoulders are generally wide enough for 5-6’ conventional bike lanes. I recommend keeping vehicular lanes to 11’ through this segment. There is a major pinch point at the CSX rail bridge. Speeds are probably high, but a dashed ending to the bike lane and sharrows approaching the underpass could be effective. South to Watson Ave. the ROW is 35-36’ wide, so 11’ vehicle lanes and 6-7’ bike lanes are feasible as you enter Langhorne.

The bridge under the rail yard is a major pinch point, but worth taking a look at in the future. Heading east, existing shoulders are wide enough for a generous buffered bike lane in each direction (6-7’ bike lanes with 2-3’ buffers). It looks like the shoulders are occasionally used for on-street parking up to Makefield Rd., which may be something to check in with the Township about. Please see DVRPC’s guidance for bike/ped facilities at expressway interchanges (https://www.dvrpc.org/Reports/19025.pdf) when looking at the Woolston Dr./Lincoln Hwy/Route 1 onramp. 
East of W. Trenton Ave, the road has excess lane capacity. I’d recommend reducing to a single vehicle lane per direction, and buffered bike lanes can be included as part of a narrowing strategy. There aren’t a ton of bikeable destinations here at the moment, but there’s no reason not to do a safe lane, and it could become useful if the large commercial/industrial parcels here ever get redeveloped.

Use the same sharrow treatment to get by other auxiliary lanes west of 113. 

Unfortunately, we cannot allow the sharrows to continue east of 9th St due to the high ADT and 3 lane section by the College then parking within Collegeville.  So the bike facility will end at 9th St but that does connect it to Ursinus College.   If the desire is to connect to the Perkiomen Trail consideration should be given to evaluating if 9th Avenue has a low enough ADT for sharrows to be placed directing cyclists to use it to access the Perk Trail at 29 and 9th.

Bike lanes are feasible between Pottstown Pike and Newcomen Road. 
At Pottstown Pike, lanes can be narrowed to 11 ft to build a 5 foot bicycle lane in the existing EB shoulder and between the through and right turn lane WB. Halfway to Bausman Road, the shoulders widen considerably allowing for buffered bike lanes on the EB side of the road up Newcomen Road. WB the shoulder slightly in the approach to the Newcomen Road intersection, here you could move the center line slightly and diet the lanes to create enough space for a bike lane, or slightly widen the shoulder in the 100' approach to the intersection. 

The roadway between Newcomen and Valley Hill Road (where the Uwchlan trail begins) would also benefit from widening. It currently narrows to roughly 26' and has AADT's (2018) of ~8400. This is too high to safely do sharrows. Widening by 6 feet here would provide enough shoulder to create a consistent bike lane here.

"," Low (~2500) AADT and speed (25 mph) between E 4th St. and E 12th St. allow for bike lanes. There is not adequate ROW from the I-95 overpass to E 14h St. intersection, at which point a road diet would be best for cyclist comfort- AADT is about 4000, a four lane cross section is not necessary. Recommend continuing the road diet through the entirety of the four-lane cross section, which ends at E 22nd St. From there until the Harvey St. intersection, the centerline can be shifted to make space for bike lanes on either side (cartway is about 30' wide). Recommend narrowing lanes at the Harvey Rd. intersection to 10 feet to make space for a bike lane on both shoulders of PA-320 until the shoulder widens considerably after the Sproul Ln. intersection. Recommend continuing a buffered bike lane on either side (which will require removing the shared turn lane from the Canterbury Drive intersection to the 476 overpass, and narrowing lanes after 476 overpass). Once the bike lanes terminate at Fairview Road, recommend installing sharrows on local N-S roads (such as Cornell Ave. or Rutgers Ave.), as PA-320 narrows considerably while maintaining a high AADT (~10000) and becomes unsuitable for cyclists. To establish a connection to the North side of the Swarthmore station, it is recommended to install a bikable shoulder from the Fieldhouse Ln. traffic circle to College Ave.

ECG notes from Daniel Paschall: Shawn Megill-Legendre has led the coordination with DelDOT and PennDOT to ensure continuous bike lanes across the state border into Marcus Hook. It would also be great to get bike lanes installed going from Marcus Hook into Chester, from Price St to Highland Ave. See the Circuit Trails map for that segment as ""Planned"". Also, it looks like only sharrows would be able to fit within the right-of-way for downtown Marcus Hook, Green St to Church St, but that would still be an improvement (also ""Planned"" on the Circuit Map).",Yes,2021-10-01 09:51:45,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,"Maintaining existing bicycle facilities is recommended. North bound lane, need to ensure plans reflect tie in with DelDOT's bike lanes as discussed with DVRPC & DelDOT. Prefer to add double white lines for bike lanes where there is parking on street. The installation of sharrows from Green St to Church St in Marcus Hook appears feasible to connect the existing bike lanes north and south of this segment. Bike lanes are possible over Markus Hook Creek Bridge, butthere is at least one parking spot impact in WB direction, just west of the bridge at the intersection with Walnut.  

North of Price St, the existing bike lane terminates.  The roadway width from Price St to Highland Ave width varies from 30' to 36'. Installation of bike lanes appears feasible from Price St to Harwick St. 

On W 4th St from Harwick St to Highland Ave and on Highland Ave, roadway width appears to be 36' with on-street parking heavily utilized on both sides, therefore removal of parking for bike lanes not recommended along this segment. The installation of sharrows appears feasible along this segment.

On W 9t St from Highland Ave to Engle St, ADT = 11,000 and roadway width appears to be 36' with one travel lane in each direction and on-street parking either restricted or not heavily utilized. Installation of bike lanes appears feasible along this segment. Access to Memorial Park seems to be better served by utilizing a local road (W 7th St or W 6th St) insead of W 9th St (SR 13) due to high traffic volume. 

North of Engle St, roadway width generally appears to be 36' with one travel lane in each direction and on-street parking. On-street parking appears to be heavily utilized in most areas along this segment. Therefore, removal of on-street parking and installation of bike lanes not recommended.
